# Advent of Code 2022

My daily submissions for the Advent of Code 2022 Christmas challenge.

See [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) for more information.

My solutions will be implemented in Node.js

## Prerequisites

To run each solution, you will need have Node.js installed on your machine.

See [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) or use [Download NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)

## Instructions on how to run the daily solutions

The solutions are split up into folders e.g. `day-1`, `day-2`, `day-3`.

Each day is split up into further sub folders e.g. `part-1` and `part-2`

### Running a solution example

- Change the directory to the relevant day and part e.g. for Day 1, Part 1 `cd day-1 && cd part-1`
- Execute the script `node index.js`

The output of the problem will display in the console.
